# videobrowser
About
The application takes sample videos from youtube and displays it on the sidebar, The sidebar contains a search box. By typing the name of the video the application sorts it from the name of the video and displays it.

Approach and initial idea

The idea was to build a sidebar that displays the sample videos and after the particular video is searched it should route to another page that plays the video.

What it actually does-

The  side bar contains and plays the sample video that is searched by the user.

Steps to run the application
1.Download the folder(videobrowser)
2.Open the application via browser
3.Navigate to the sidebar and searh for the video.


Problems faced
 Major time consumption in building this application went into solving a simple error, The videos werent getting played because of simple mistake in ng-repeat directive that I couldn't pin down on time
